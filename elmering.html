  <h2 class="www_sectiontitle">Are you asking any of the following questions?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>How do I get help in getting started with ham radio?</li>
    <li>How do I get help with some aspect or project that I am trying to do?</li>
    <li>HELP, I bought a radio now WHAT do I do?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Well, if you are asking any of the above questions or similar things,
  then we may have a solution for you. It is called finding
  an "ELMER". An Elmer is a person who can help you with knowledge or skills
  to assist you with your issues. An Elmer is a volunteer that can help or
  provide contact to someone who can help. Ham Radio has a strong and rich
  history or mentoring (we refer to it as Elmering) new hams, and helping
  them get going in the hobby.</p>


  <p>Ham Radio is a hobby that covers a lot of subjects, which can be
  very overwhelming to new comers. My advice is to seek help and
  not to get frustrated. There are many ways to get help.</p>

  <pre>First I would suggest get signed up on the mailing list at Groups.io here:
    <a href="https://groups.io/g/Orlando147120Repeater">147.120 Projects</a>
  </pre>

  <p>This will put you in contact with a lot of local people who can help.</p>

  <p>Second, If you have your ham license, then get on the 147.120
  repeater and let someone know your looking for some help. There
  are many very helpful local hams on the repeater.</p>

  <p>Third, come to one of the local gatherings. we meet on the first
  and third Saturday at Bob Evans in Fern Park at 5:00 PM. Lots of
  local hams who can answer questions. Here is the location: <strong>Bob Evans,
  385 Florida 436 Casselberry, Florida 32730</strong></p>
